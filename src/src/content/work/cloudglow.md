cloudGlow is a cloud management platform that allows you to manage your Azure resources in a secure and easy way. It's a product that I started in 2019. The project is built with Blazor, a C#-based web framework that compiles to WebAssembly. This allows us to write the entire application in C#, including the frontend, and have it run in the browser. The backend is built with ASP.NET Core, a C#-based web framework that runs on the server. It doesn't use a database, instead it uses the Microsoft Graph API to interact with the Azure tenant.
