Brandplane is a SaaS platform that uses AI to generate strategies for brand identity. We worked with the Brandplane team to develop a brand identity and website that would appeal to their target audience of marketing professionals.

In this project I work as CTO and lead developer. I am responsible for the technical direction of the project, as well as the implementation of the frontend and backend.

More info about the product [here](https://www.brandplane.co/).

## The Tech Stack
Brandplane is built with Blazor, a C#-based web framework that compiles to WebAssembly. This allows us to write the entire application in C#, including the frontend, and have it run in the browser. The backend is built with ASP.NET Core, a C#-based web framework that runs on the server. The database is built with SQL Server, a relational database management system.
Everything is hosted on Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform.
